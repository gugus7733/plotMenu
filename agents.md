When given a list of points to modify, follow these instructions :
- Adress them point by point like they were several separate requests
- After addressing them, make a final checkup of the code to make sure it is coherent on indentation and statements so it can be run directly.
- Only add new files if absolutely necessary, otherwise keep it all in a single file.
